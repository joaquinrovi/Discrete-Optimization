    "Write an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem (a.k.a. minimize the length of a hamiltonian cycle of a graph). The problem is mathematically formulated in the following way: Given a list of locations $N = 0 . . . n − 1$ and coordinates for each location $〈x_{i}, y_{i}〉$ $i ∈ N$ . Let $v_{i}$, $i ∈ N$ be a variable denoting the visitation order (i.e. the value of vi is the $i$-th location to be visited) and let $dist(l_{1}, l_{2})$ be the Euclidean distance between two locations. Then the traveling, salesman problem is formalized as the following optimization problem,\n",
