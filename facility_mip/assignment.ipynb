    "# Facility location\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an algorithm in Python to solve the facility location problem. The problem is mathematically formulated in the following way: there are $F$ = $0,1,...,f-1$ facilities to choose from and $C$ =  $0,1,...,c-1$ customers that need to be served. Each facility, $f \\in F$ has a setup cost $s_{f}$ and a capacity $cap_{f}$. Each customer, $c \\in C$ has a demand $d_{c}$. Both the facilities and customers are located in a Euclidean space, $〈x_{i}, y_{i}〉$, $i \\in F \\cup C$. The cost to delived goods to a particular customer $c$ from a facility $f$ is the Euclidean distance between two locations, $dist_{f,c}$. Lastly, all customers must be served by exactly one facility. Let $a_{f}$ be a decision variable denoting if a facility $f$ is open or not and let $b_{f,c}$ be another decision variable denoting if a customer $c$ is served by a facility $f$. The facility location problem is formalized as the following optimization problem.\n",

    "The input consists of $|F|$ + $|C|$ + 1 lines. The first line contains two numbers, $|F|$ followed by $|C|$. The first line is followed by $|F|$ lines, where each line encodes the facility’s setup cost $s_{f}$ , capacity $cap_{f}$ , and the location $x_{f}$ , $y_{f}$. The remaining $|C|$ lines capture the customer information, where each line encodes the customer’s demand, $d_{c}$, and location $x_{c}$, $y_{c}$.\n",
